# STEP 3 ======================================================

# script. If it echoes correctly you can delete these two commands
# and go to the next step

# STEP 5 ======================================================
# Use the `git remote add origin` command to add the remote origin
# Use the value of the SSH variable at the end of the command
#
# AI Prompt: "I want to use the value of the SSH variable at the end of `git remote add origin` in a bash script, but I don't want to store the command in a string first"

# If the command fails with an exit code, echo the following message

# to a variable named GITIGNORE_URL
#
# If user chose Python above: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Python.gitignore
# If user chose Django above: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedroserrudo/django-gitignore/main/.gitignore

# STEP 7 ======================================================
# Use the `curl` command to GET the URL that you defined above. Run it in silent mode and store the response in `.gitignore`
#
# AI Prompt: "In a bash script, Ii want to use curl. The url is stored in a variable. I want to use silent mode. I want the response I get to be stored in a file named .gitignore."












# STEP 8 ======================================================
# Check if the .gitignore file was created
#   https://linuxize.com/post/bash-check-if-file-exists/
#
# If it was show message ".gitignore created"
# If it wasn't show message "FAILED: .gitignore was not created"

# Capture the response code from curl in the variable STATUS_CODE
#   https://codefather.tech/blog/curl-bash-script/
# Only check for the existence of the file is STATUS_CODE equals 200
